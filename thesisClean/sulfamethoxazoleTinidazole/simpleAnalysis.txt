Regression 1:
 constant -> the probability of being prescribed conditional on having a relevant diagnosis before generic enters the market
 genericOn coefficient + constant -> probability of being prescribed conditional on having a relevant diagnosis after generic enter the market

  Added slopes for amount of time until generic comes on (monthsBeforeGeneric) and amount of time generic has been on (monthsAfterGeneric)

Regression 3:
  Added monthly indicators with January as base case
