	abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the practice pattern of off-label use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) in ambulatory settings and to identify the related risk factors. Methods The National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys from 2006 through 2012 was used to identify subjects who received FQ off-label prescriptions. We defined off-label use as the use of FQs for indications other than those in the FDA-approved drug label. Descriptive statistics were calculated by using a series of weighted chi-squared statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with off-label FQ drug use. Results There were 93 million ambulatory visits in which an FQ was prescribed, and 53.16\% of these visits involved the prescribing of FQs in an off-label manner. The percentage of off-label prescriptions was the highest among individuals ≥80 years old (61.6\%) and male patients (60.9\%). The FQ drug prescribed most for an off-label indication in our study was ciprofloxacin (29.5\% of the total visits). The multivariate analysis showed that age of ≥80 years and male patient was significantly associated with off-label use of FQs (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.66, 1.72–7.80 and OR 3.26, 2.32–4.56, respectively). Medicaid or private insurance versus Medicare were associated with significantly higher off-label prescribing of FQs (OR 2.53, 1.28–5.01 and 1.77, 1.03–3.03, respectively). Conclusion The percentage of visits involving off-label FQs in US ambulatory settings is substantial. Efforts are needed consolidate and evaluate what high-quality scientific evidence is available and what is needed to support the safety and effectiveness of such off-label uses.

	abstract = {Context: The impact of national efforts to limit antibiotic prescribing has not been fully evaluated. Objectives: To analyze trends in outpatient visits associated with antibiotic prescription for U.S. adults. Design: Cross-sectional study of data (1995 to 2002) from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Participants: Adults ≥18 years with an outpatient visit to an office- or hospital-based medical practice or to an emergency department. All visits were classified into 1 of 4 diagnostic categories: (1) acute respiratory infection (ARI)—antibiotics rarely indicated, (2) ARI—antibiotics often indicated, (3) nonrespiratory infection—antibiotics often indicated, and (4) all others. Measurements: Trends in: (1) Proportion of outpatient visits associated with an antibiotic prescription; (2) proportion of antibiotic prescriptions that were broad spectrum; and (3) number of visits and antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 U.S. adults ≥18 years of age. Results: From 1995–1996 to 2001–2002, the proportion of all outpatient visits that generated an antibiotic prescription decreased from 17.9\% to 15.3\% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.92). The entire reduction was because of a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions associated with visits for ARIs where antibiotics are rarely indicated from 59.9\% to 49.1\% (adjusted OR 0.64 95\% CI 0.51 to 0.80). However, the proportion of prescribed antibiotics for these visits that were classified as broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription increased from 41.0\% to 76.8\%. Overall outpatient visits increased from 1693 to 1986 per 1,000 adults over the 8 years studied, but associated antibiotic prescriptions changed little, from 302 to 304 per 1,000 adults. Conclusion: During the study period, outpatient antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections where antibiotics are rarely indicated has declined, while the proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed for these diagnoses has increased significantly. This trend resulted in a 15\% decline in the total proportion of outpatient visits in which antibiotics were prescribed. However, because outpatient visits increased 17\% over this time period, the population burden of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions changed little.},

Participants Adults aged 65 and older in the United States. Measurements Information on outpatient antibiotic prescriptions dispensed for older adults from 2011 to 2014 was extracted from the IQVIA Xponent database. A chi-square trend analysis was conducted to assess annual changes in antibiotic prescribing rates. A descriptive analysis of prescribing rates by antibiotic, age group, sex, state, Census region, and provider specialty was conducted. Results From 2011 to 2014, outpatient antibiotic prescribing rates remained stable in older U.S. adults (P = .89). In 2014, older adults were dispensed 51.6 million prescriptions (1,115 prescriptions/1,000 persons). Persons aged 75 and older had a higher prescribing rate (1,157 prescriptions/1,000 persons) than those aged 65 to 74 (1,084 prescriptions/1,000 persons). Prescribing rates were highest in the South 1228 prescriptions/1,000 persons) and lowest in the West (854 prescriptions/1,000 persons). The most commonly prescribed class was quinolones, followed by penicillins and macrolides. Azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed drug, followed by amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. Internists and family physicians prescribed 43\% of antibiotic courses. Conclusion On average, in 2014, U.S. adults aged 65 and older received enough outpatient antibiotic courses for every older adult to receive at least 1. Quinolones and azithromycin are potential targets for assessing the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in this population. Interventions to improve use targeting internists and family physicians in the South Census region might have the potential to have the greatest effect.},

	abstract = {Purpose Generic medications used for chronic diseases are beneficial in containing healthcare costs and improving drug accessibility. However, the effects of generic drugs in acute and severe illness remain controversial. This study aims to investigate treatment costs and outcomes of generic antibiotics prescribed for adults with a urinary tract infection in outpatient settings. Methods The data source was the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. We included outpatients aged 20 years and above with a urinary tract infection who required one oral antibiotic for which brand-name and generic products were simultaneously available. Drug cost and overall healthcare expense of the index consultation, healthcare cost during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were the main dependent variables. Data were compared between brand-name and generic users from the entire cohort and a propensity score-matched samples. Results Results from the entire cohort and propensity score-matched samples were similar. Daily antibiotic cost was significantly lower among generic users than brand-name users. Significant lower total drug claims of the index consultation only existed in patients receiving the investigated antibiotics, while the drug price between brand-name and generic versions were relatively large (e.g., {\textgreater}50\%). The overall healthcare cost of the index consultation, healthcare expenditure during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were similar between the two groups. Conclusions Compared with those treated with brand-name antibiotics, outpatients who received generic antibiotics had equivalent treatment outcomes with lower drug costs. Generic antibiotics are effective and worthy of adoption among outpatients with simple infections indicating oral antibiotic treatment. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Growing antimicrobial resistance and a dwindling antibiotic pipeline have resulted in an emerging postantibiotic era, as patients are now dying from bacterial infections that were once treatable. The fast-paced “Golden Age” of antibiotic development that started in the 1940s has lost momentum; from the 1980s to the early 2000s, there was a 90\% decline in the approval of new antibiotics as well as the discovery of few new novel classes. Many companies have shifted away from development due to scientific, regulatory, and economic hurdles that proved antibiotic development to be less attractive compared with more lucrative therapeutic areas. National and global efforts are focusing attention toward potential solutions for reinvigorating the antibiotic pipeline and include “push” incentives such as public–private partnerships and “pull” incentives such as reimbursement reform and market exclusivity. Hybrid models of incentives, global coordination among stakeholders, and the appropriate balance of antibiotic pricing, volume of drug used, and proper antimicrobial stewardship are key to maximizing efforts toward drug development to ensure access to patients in need of these therapies.},
