            Nationally representative data from 2000–2015 demonstrated a rise in the incidence of outpatient visits for skin infections, peaking in 2010–2013, followed by a plateau. While cephalexin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic at the beginning, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was most frequently prescribed by the end of the study period.},

	abstract = {Rationale, aims, and objectives Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is still a major concern that can lead to devastating outcomes including antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to simulate the antibiotic prescribing behaviour by providers for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and to evaluate the impact of patient expectation, provider's perception of patient's expectation to receive a prescription, and patient's risk for bacterial infection, on the decision to prescribe. Methods We developed a unique system dynamics (SD) simulation model based on the significant factors that impact the interaction between provider and patient during visits for ARTIs and the decision to prescribe antibiotics. In order to validate the model for different age groups and regions in the United States, we used the sample of 53 000 ARTI patient visits made at outpatient settings between 1993 and 2015, based on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Results Simulation results reveal that physician diagnosis for prescribing antibiotics is based on physician's experience from their prior prescribing behaviour, their perception of patient's infection risk, and patient's expectation to receive antibiotics. Also, there are some variations depending on patient's age and residential region. The simulation analysis also depicts the decreasing trend in patient's expectation over the past two decades for most age groups and regions. Conclusions Given the high number of unnecessary prescriptions for ARTI, we found that policies are needed to influence provider's prescribing behaviour through patient's expectation and provider's perception regarding those expectations. Our simulation framework can further be used by policymakers to design and evaluate interventions that may modify the interaction between health providers and patients to optimize antibiotic prescriptions among ARTI patients for different regions and age groups.},

	abstract = {The aim of the analysis was to determine whether demand in Germany for speciﬁc antimicrobial agents is driven by prices that drop considerably when generic substitutes become available. A time-series approach was therefore carried out to explore price elasticities of demand for two different classes of broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ﬂuoroquinolones and cephalosporins) using data on ambulatory antibiotics prescribed on the German statutory health insurance scheme and data on in-hospital antibiotic use in a German teaching hospital. In short, we attempted to explain demand for different antibiotics based on changes in price and hospital-wide morbidity. The data indicate that patent expiration is followed by substantial decreases in the price of antibiotics. In the outpatient sector, all antibiotics included in the analysis showed signiﬁcant negative own-price elasticities of demand.},

	abstract = {The use of stated preference analyses to evaluate choice of health care products has been growing in recent years. This paper shows how revealed preference data can be enriched with stated preference data and highlights the relative advantages of revealed and stated preference data. The techniques were applied to a study of determinants of physicians' prescriptions of alcoholism medications. Analyses were conducted on the relationship between physicians' perceptions of existing alcoholism medication attributes and their prescribing rates of those medications. Analyses were also conducted on physicians' decisions to prescribe hypothetical alcoholism medications with varying attributes such as efficacy, side effects, compliance, mode of action, and price. Finally, analyses were conducted on the combined stated and revealed preference data. Joint estimation suggests that parameters from the revealed and stated preference data are equal, up to scale. Joint analyses highlight how stated preference data can be used to estimate parameters for attributes that are not observed in the marketplace, that do not vary in the marketplace, or that are highly collinear with other attributes in actual markets.

	abstract = {According to economic theory, one might expect that the informational content of direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only drugs would improve consumers' welfare. However, contrasting the models of consumer and market behaviour underlying this theory with the realities of the prescription-only drug market reveals that this market is distinct in ways that render it unlikely that advertising will serve an unbiased and strictly informative function. A review of qualitative evidence regarding the informational content of drug advertising supports this conclusion. Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising concentrates on particular products, and features of those products, to the exclusion of others, and the information provided has frequently been found to be biased or misleading in regulatory and academic evaluations. Governments that have so far resisted direct-to-consumer advertising should invest in independent sources of evidence that could help consumers and professionals to better understand the risks and benefits of treating disease with alternative drug and non-drug therapies, rather than permitting direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising.},

This paper focuses on communication between doctors and patients within the doctor-patient relationship as a method by which the utility of the principal (patient) can be maximised. Patients’ preferences for various attributes of the doctor-patient relationship are examined using a discrete choice experiment. Individuals were presented with pairs of hypothetical scenarios describing GP visits that differed depending on the attributes of the doctor-patient relationship. In the time-constrained GP consultation, the results show that being able to talk to the doctor is the most important attribute, followed by patients’ understanding of the doctor’s explanations, waiting time for an appointment, and the amount of information transferred to the patient. Quality of information is more important than its quantity. The extent to which patients were involved in decision making had no influence on the choice of visit, although it was important to patients who were relatively young and female. Policies aimed at involving patients in decision making should be targeted at specific groups of patients only. The results have implications for the training of doctors in communication skills as a response to market failure caused by asymmetry of information.},
