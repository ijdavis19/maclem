\noindent \textbf{Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim}\\
Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim is a combination antibiotic from the class antimetabolite/sulfonamide. The brands of the drug include Bactrim, Bactrim DS, Septra, and Septra DS and the generic form entered the American market in July of 2012. The antibiotic works through sulfamethoxazole inhibiting bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid by competing with \textit{para}-aminobenzoic acid and trimethoprim blocking the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the required enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase.\\
\\
The drug has FDA approval to fight urinary tract infections, acute otitis media (ear infections), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults, Shigellosis, treatment and prophylaxis of \textit{Pneumocystis jirovecii} pneumonia, and Traveler's diarrhea in a adults. The antibiotic is also used for infections due to \textit{Listeria, Nocardia, Salmonella, Brucella, Paracoccidioides,} melioidosis, \textit{Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas,} cyclospora, isospora, Whipple's disease, and alterntive therapy for toxoplasmosis and community-acquired MRSA skin infections.\\
\\
Due to possible interference with folic acid metabolism, there is potential risk to the fetus if taken during pregnancy. Hence, it is only recommended that the drug is taken during pregnancy if the potential risks are outweighed by the possible benefits.\\
