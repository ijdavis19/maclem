\begin{itemize}
\item Apologize for not making the google sheet
\item Figured out the do files but am considering doing a rewrite to better understand heckit and some of the data they were using
\item Created a data needs document
\item Still need to 
\item do we need yearly cross sections like the chicago guys have?
\item Looked into DHS and IPUMS
\item IPUMS looks better because you can pull variables for multiple countries in one data set (I think)
\item DHS is once every 5 years kinda and each survey is its own dataset
\item I'm imagining pulling by region and doing that level of analysis to start, splitting continents between Krishna and myself.
\end{itemize}
