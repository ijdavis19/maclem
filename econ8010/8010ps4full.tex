\textbf{A. } For the utility function $U = (X_1 - a)^\alpha (X_2 - b)^\beta$,\\
\\
1. Find the income elasticities of demand for goods 1 and 2.\\
\\
2. Find the own- price elasticity of demand for good 1.\\
\\
3. Find the cross-elasticitity of demand for good 1 with respect to the price of good 2. 
\\
4. Verify the relevant adding up coniditions.\\
\\
5. Explain how it models "needs".\\
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{B. }For the utilityfunction $U = \alpha Y + \beta X - (\gamma /2)X^2$, derive the demand function for X.\\
\\
1. What is the general shape of this demand funciton?\\
\\
2. What is the income elasticity of demand for X?\\
\\
3. What is the implied income elasticity of demand for Y?\\
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{C: }For the utility function $U = \gamma (\alpha X^\rho + \beta Y^\rho )^{\mu / \rho }$, find the elasticity of substitution between X and Y.\\
\\
\\
\\
\textbf{B: }If we find that an individual's 1990 consumption bundle cost \$20,000 in 1990 and \$30,000 in 2000 and this same person's 2000 consumption bundle cost \$45,000 in 2000 and \$20,000 in 1990, we can reject the hypothesis that this individual has stable, homothetic preferences.
