	abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to determine trends in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of erythromycin used as first-line therapy and alternative antibiotics against Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) strains isolated from patients with whooping cough in the Czech Republic (CR) in three periods from 1967 to 2015.
Methods: In total, 135 isolates from the years 1967–2015 were analysed. The strains were divided into three groups by the year of isolation: 1967–1999 (42 strains), 2004–2010 (43 strains), and 2011–2015 (50 strains). MIC of selected antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were obtained by the reference agar dilution method on Bordet Gengou Agar with 15\% defibrinated sheep blood.
Results: The study set included 70 strains previously tested for MICs of erythromycin and four other antibiotics. In the three study periods, the MICs of the tested antibiotics for B. pertussis were nearly identical. All but a single strain, inhibited by erythromycin at a concentration of 0.03 mg/l, were inhibited by two concentrations of erythromycin and azithromycin (0.06 and 0.125 mg/l). Clarithromycin inhibited the strains from all three study periods at the following concentrations: 0.03, 0.06, and 0.125 mg/l. Any of the 135 strains was inhibited by ciprofloxacin at a single concentration of 0.06 mg/l and by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at three concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/l).
Conclusion: The study set of 135 Czech strains of B. pertussis isolated in 1967–2015 appears to be homogeneous in terms of the MICs for five antimicrobials. The MICs remained in a narrow range of two to three low concentrations; the unimodal distribution of the MICs suggests the absence of resistance mechanisms. The highest MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were equally 0.125 mg/l, that of ciprofloxacin was 0.06 mg/l, and that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 0.5 mg/l. Over the study period of 55 years, the MICs of the study antibiotics remained in the same ranges.},

	abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in Latin America between 1997 to 2000 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. In the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. The patients’ mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6\%). Esherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Among the E. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious UTI in Latin America (91.0 –100.0\% susceptible). High resistance rates to ﬂuoroquinolones (17.5–18.9\%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Ͼ45.0\%) were observed among the E. coli. In contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of Ͼ 87.0\%. Against Klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (Ͼ30.0\%) producing extended-spectrum ␤-lactamases (ESBL). Even the new ﬂuoroquinolones showed limited activity against Klebsiella spp. (72.1– 88.6\% susceptible) and the P. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. The results of this survey endorse the importance of Enterobacteriaceae as cause of UTI in Latin America. Our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the Latin American medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciproﬂoxacin-resistant E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, contrasting the models of consumer and market behaviour underlying this theory with the realities of the prescription-only drug market reveals that this market is distinct in ways that render it unlikely that advertising will serve an unbiased and strictly informative function. A review of qualitative evidence regarding the informational content of drug advertising supports this conclusion. Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising concentrates on particular products, and features of those products, to the exclusion of others, and the information provided has frequently been found to be biased or misleading in regulatory and academic evaluations. Governments that have so far resisted direct-to-consumer advertising should invest in independent sources of evidence that could help consumers and professionals to better understand the risks and benefits of treating disease with alternative drug and non-drug therapies, rather than permitting direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising.},

However, the effects of generic drugs in acute and severe illness remain controversial. This study aims to investigate treatment costs and outcomes of generic antibiotics prescribed for adults with a urinary tract infection in outpatient settings. Methods The data source was the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. We included outpatients aged 20 years and above with a urinary tract infection who required one oral antibiotic for which brand-name and generic products were simultaneously available. Drug cost and overall healthcare expense of the index consultation, healthcare cost during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were the main dependent variables. Data were compared between brand-name and generic users from the entire cohort and a propensity score-matched samples. Results Results from the entire cohort and propensity score-matched samples were similar. Daily antibiotic cost was significantly lower among generic users than brand-name users. Significant lower total drug claims of the index consultation only existed in patients receiving the investigated antibiotics, while the drug price between brand-name and generic versions were relatively large (e.g., {\textgreater}50\%). The overall healthcare cost of the index consultation, healthcare expenditure during a 42-day follow-up period, and treatment failure rates were similar between the two groups. Conclusions Compared with those treated with brand-name antibiotics, outpatients who received generic antibiotics had equivalent treatment outcomes with lower drug costs. Generic antibiotics are effective and worthy of adoption among outpatients with simple infections indicating oral antibiotic treatment. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rationale, aims, and objectives Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is still a major concern that can lead to devastating outcomes including antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to simulate the antibiotic prescribing behaviour by providers for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and to evaluate the impact of patient expectation, provider's perception of patient's expectation to receive a prescription, and patient's risk for bacterial infection, on the decision to prescribe. Methods We developed a unique system dynamics (SD) simulation model based on the significant factors that impact the interaction between provider and patient during visits for ARTIs and the decision to prescribe antibiotics. In order to validate the model for different age groups and regions in the United States, we used the sample of 53 000 ARTI patient visits made at outpatient settings between 1993 and 2015, based on the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Results Simulation results reveal that physician diagnosis for prescribing antibiotics is based on physician's experience from their prior prescribing behaviour, their perception of patient's infection risk, and patient's expectation to receive antibiotics. Also, there are some variations depending on patient's age and residential region. The simulation analysis also depicts the decreasing trend in patient's expectation over the past two decades for most age groups and regions. Conclusions Given the high number of unnecessary prescriptions for ARTI, we found that policies are needed to influence provider's prescribing behaviour through patient's expectation and provider's perception regarding those expectations. Our simulation framework can further be used by policymakers to design and evaluate interventions that may modify the interaction between health providers and patients to optimize antibiotic prescriptions among ARTI patients for different regions and age groups.},

	abstract = {Objectives To characterize antibiotics prescribed to older adults to guide efforts to improve antibiotic use. Design Descriptive analysis. Setting Ambulatory. Participants Adults aged 65 and older in the United States. Measurements Information on outpatient antibiotic prescriptions dispensed for older adults from 2011 to 2014 was extracted from the IQVIA Xponent database. A chi-square trend analysis was conducted to assess annual changes in antibiotic prescribing rates. A descriptive analysis of prescribing rates by antibiotic, age group, sex, state, Census region, and provider specialty was conducted. Results From 2011 to 2014, outpatient antibiotic prescribing rates remained stable in older U.S. adults (P = .89). In 2014, older adults were dispensed 51.6 million prescriptions (1,115 prescriptions/1,000 persons). Persons aged 75 and older had a higher prescribing rate (1,157 prescriptions/1,000 persons) than those aged 65 to 74 (1,084 prescriptions/1,000 persons). Prescribing rates were highest in the South 1228 prescriptions/1,000 persons) and lowest in the West (854 prescriptions/1,000 persons). The most commonly prescribed class was quinolones, followed by penicillins and macrolides. Azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed drug, followed by amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. Internists and family physicians prescribed 43\% of antibiotic courses. Conclusion On average, in 2014, U.S. adults aged 65 and older received enough outpatient antibiotic courses for every older adult to receive at least 1. Quinolones and azithromycin are potential targets for assessing the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in this population. Interventions to improve use targeting internists and family physicians in the South Census region might have the potential to have the greatest effect.},

	abstract = {Context: The impact of national efforts to limit antibiotic prescribing has not been fully evaluated. Objectives: To analyze trends in outpatient visits associated with antibiotic prescription for U.S. adults. Design: Cross-sectional study of data (1995 to 2002) from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Participants: Adults ≥18 years with an outpatient visit to an office- or hospital-based medical practice or to an emergency department. All visits were classified into 1 of 4 diagnostic categories: (1) acute respiratory infection (ARI)—antibiotics rarely indicated, (2) ARI—antibiotics often indicated, (3) nonrespiratory infection—antibiotics often indicated, and (4) all others. Measurements: Trends in: (1) Proportion of outpatient visits associated with an antibiotic prescription; (2) proportion of antibiotic prescriptions that were broad spectrum; and (3) number of visits and antibiotic prescriptions per 1,000 U.S. adults ≥18 years of age. Results: From 1995–1996 to 2001–2002, the proportion of all outpatient visits that generated an antibiotic prescription decreased from 17.9\% to 15.3\% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95 \% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.92). The entire reduction was because of a decrease in antibiotic prescriptions associated with visits for ARIs where antibiotics are rarely indicated from 59.9\% to 49.1\% (adjusted OR 0.64 95\% CI 0.51 to 0.80). However, the proportion of prescribed antibiotics for these visits that were classified as broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription increased from 41.0\% to 76.8\%. Overall outpatient visits increased from 1693 to 1986 per 1,000 adults over the 8 years studied, but associated antibiotic prescriptions changed little, from 302 to 304 per 1,000 adults. Conclusion: During the study period, outpatient antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections where antibiotics are rarely indicated has declined, while the proportion of broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed for these diagnoses has increased significantly. This trend resulted in a 15\% decline in the total proportion of outpatient visits in which antibiotics were prescribed. However, because outpatient visits increased 17\% over this time period, the population burden of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions changed little.},

	abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the practice pattern of off-label use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) in ambulatory settings and to identify the related risk factors. Methods The National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys from 2006 through 2012 was used to identify subjects who received FQ off-label prescriptions. We defined off-label use as the use of FQs for indications other than those in the FDA-approved drug label. Descriptive statistics were calculated by using a series of weighted chi-squared statistics. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with off-label FQ drug use. Results There were 93 million ambulatory visits in which an FQ was prescribed, and 53.16\% of these visits involved the prescribing of FQs in an off-label manner. The percentage of off-label prescriptions was the highest among individuals ≥80 years old (61.6\%) and male patients (60.9\%). The FQ drug prescribed most for an off-label indication in our study was ciprofloxacin (29.5\% of the total visits). The multivariate analysis showed that age of ≥80 years and male patient was significantly associated with off-label use of FQs (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.66, 1.72–7.80 and OR 3.26, 2.32–4.56, respectively). Medicaid or private insurance versus Medicare were associated with significantly higher off-label prescribing of FQs (OR 2.53, 1.28–5.01 and 1.77, 1.03–3.03, respectively). Conclusion The percentage of visits involving off-label FQs in US ambulatory settings is substantial. Efforts are needed consolidate and evaluate what high-quality scientific evidence is available and what is needed to support the safety and effectiveness of such off-label uses.

	abstract = {Many have hailed the widespread use of generic drugs as one of the most important public-health developments of the twenty-first century. Today, almost 90 percent of our pharmaceutical market is comprised of generics, the majority of which are manufactured overseas. We have been reassured by our doctors, our pharmacists and our regulators that generic drugs are identical to their brand-name counterparts, just less expensive. But is this really true? Katherine Eban's Bottle of Lies exposes the deceit behind generic-drug manufacturing--and the attendant risks for global health. Drawing on exclusive accounts from whistleblowers and regulators, as well as thousands of pages of confidential FDA documents, Eban reveals an industry where fraud is rampant, companies routinely falsify data, and executives circumvent almost every principle of safe manufacturing to minimize cost and maximize profit, confident in their ability to fool inspectors. Meanwhile, patients unwittingly consume medicine with unpredictable and dangerous effects. The story of generic drugs is truly global. It connects middle America to China, India, sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, and represents the ultimate litmus test of globalization: what are the risks of moving drug manufacturing offshore, and are they worth the savings?" -- Amazon.com},

In our discrete-continuous choice model, estimated with data from a national survey, a household chooses how much money, if any, to initially spend on types of agricultural chemicals and applicators and how much time to subsequently spend on other yard work. Households in big cities or with large gardens are more likely to use organic chemicals. The probability that a household chooses a mix of do-it-yourself and hired applications of synthetic chemicals increases with income, age, and the presence of preschoolers. Among households that apply only synthetic chemicals without hired help, those with young children, with higher incomes, in big cities, and with male heads spend more on the chemicals. The time that such households spend on other yard work increases with expenditures on the chemicals. Cancellation of a pesticide registration might create an extra private cost for households with young children even though the ban might reduce external costs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}section class="abstract"{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND:  The utilization of a medicine, both before and after patent expiration, is one of the key determinants of its long-run value to society, as consumer and producer surplus accumulate as utilization occurs.  However, while utilization during the years of patent protection is followed fairly closely, usage after that is generally not, as multiple manufacturers are usually involved in the production and sale of generic alternatives.  Since utilization beyond patent expiration is poorly understood, we selected a random sample of 60 drugs and assessed their long-term, post-patent use during the period of generic competition.METHODS:  At five-year intervals beginning with the year generic competition began (YGCB), we estimated the U.S. utilization of each drug (including all generic and branded formulations) based on the number of prescriptions dispensed as projected by the National Prescription Audit\&\#x99; (1964 to 2006) conducted by IMS\&\#x99;.  These estimates were then compared to each medicine's baseline utilization, defined as the drug's usage during the last full year of patent protection \&\#x96; one year prior to the year generic competition began (YGCB-1).  The absolute utilization levels were converted into relative utilization levels, whereby a measure of 1.0 indicates that utilization in that year was equal to utilization in the baseline year.RESULTS:  Many drugs continued to be prescribed long after patent protection ended.  Even after excluding one medicine that had unusually high utilization 15 to 30 years after generic competition began, relative utilization averaged between 0.64 and 0.99 for the 5-year intervals starting with YGCB+5 and ending with YGCB+30.  This was true even though several of the medicines were available over-the-counter (OTC) during some of those years and we did not have data reflecting OTC utilization.  After excluding those OTC years (to focus on medicines that had more complete data), relative utilization averaged between 0.88 and 1.15.CONCLUSION:  Many medicines continue to be used far beyond their period of patent protection, somewhat countering the view that newer drugs quickly replace older ones.  This extended, post-patent utilization can yield additional surplus for society that is over and above the surplus generated during the period of patent protection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
