\section{Introduction and Background}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item The effectiveness of an antibiotic is an exhaustible resource and efficient use eventually renders the ineffective.
\item Over 2.8 million Americans per year are sickened by antibiotic resistant bacteria leading to at least 35,000 deaths. \textbf{CITE}
\item Through increasing the amount of treatment options available to a patient and raising aggregate demand for treatments using a given antibiotic, entry of generic antibiotics may accelerate the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research Question}
\begin{itemize}
\item How does entry of a generic form of an antibiotic affect the demand for treatments which rely on the use of the antibiotic? 
\item How does this affect differ among patient populations?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Generic Medications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hatch-Waxely
\item Now only need to show medications are Bioequivalent
\item Bioequivalent means this
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Antibiotic Usage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Much research focuses on the ambulatory setting.
\item Over 50\% of Fluoroquinole antibiotics are prescribed for patients who do not have a diagnosis associated with an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved usage. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item These non FDA approved uses are known as "off-label" uses
\end{itemize}
\item Usage rates for adults and the elderly have remained constant since the early 2000s
\item Antibiotics behave similarly to other goods in terms of own price and cross price elasticities.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sulfamethozaxole-Trimethoprim}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis focuses on Sulfamethozaxole-Trimethoprim due to its generic appearing in the middle of the observational period and having a relatively large amount of prescriptions in the data compared to other antibiotics with similar dates of entry of generics.
\item The drug is a combination antibiotic from the antimetabolite/sulfonamide class first introduced in 1968.
\item Brand name versions of the antibiotic include Bactrim, Bactrim DS, Septra and Septra DS.
\item Popular antibiotic due to its low cost and high familiarity among physicians.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sulfamethozaxole-Trimethoprim}
\begin{itemize}
\item The drug has FDA approval to fight urinary tract infections, ear infections (acute otitis media), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults, Shigellosis, treatment and prophylaxis of \textit{Pneumocystis jirovecii} pneumonia, and Traveler's diarrhea in adults.
\item The antibiotic is also approved for use against infections due to \textit{Listeria, Nocardia, Salmonella, Brucella, Paracoccidioides,} melioidosis, \textit{Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas,} cyclospora, isospora, Whipple's disease, and alternative therapy for toxoplasmosis and community-acquired MRSA skin infections.
\item Evidence has been found to indicate effectiveness in curing uncomplicated skin infections.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Economic Framework}
\begin{frame}{Theoretical Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient's, with assistance of their physician, seek to maximize their expected utility from treatment of their medical condition.
\item A patient considers both the cost and effectiveness of the treatment.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Probability condition will be cured
    \item Minimizing treatment convalescence
  \end{itemize}
\item Entry of the generic lowers the efficiency templeton phrase which would increase demand under these assumptions
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Theoretical Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build an empirical understanding of the extent to which  universities increase productivity in the manufacturing and agricultural sector.
\item Here's a point where I use $\zeta$ to see what it looks like

\begin{frame}{Empirical Analysis and Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item From 1870-1940 the size of the university system increased significantly. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Morrill Act of 1862 promoted the establishment of colleges specializing in agriculture and the mechanic arts by granting states land for education. 
\item The number of colleges in the Reports of the Commissioner of Education more than doubled from 332 to 700 with a peak of 906 colleges in 1926.
\item Total student enrollment in universities increased nearly twenty-fold from 54,033 to 1,009,945.
\end{itemize}
\item I assume colleges are plausibly located randomly when controlling for county and county-by-year.

\begin{frame}{Limitations of Study}
\begin{itemize}
\item Results are undermined if colleges are not located randomly and are instead influenced by the presence of highly productive firms.
\item Lack of consistent data throughout the period of study limited the types of studies that could be conducted and required me to make possibly inaccurate.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Recommendations for Future Research}
