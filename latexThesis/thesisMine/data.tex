\chapter{National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey}
Data used are from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) which is a nationally representative survey of outpatient medical visits. Included in the scope of the survey are freestanding clinics/urgicenters, community health centers, mental health centers, health maintenance organizations,  non-federal government clinics, family practice plans, and private solo or group practices. Not included are hospital emergency or outpatient departments, ambulatory surgicenters, institutional settings such as schools or prisons, industrial outpatient facilities, clinics operated by the federal government, and laser vision surgery centers. \cite{hing_basic_nodate}. The surveys include patient, visit, and provider characterists and weights are provided in order to create national estimates.\\
\indent I pool results from the years 2006 to 2016 and drop variables which are not consistently tracked across this time frame or have more than 30\% missing values as instructed in documentation \cite{myrick_understanding_nodate}. For the specific cases of diagnoses and prescriptions, the maximum amount of available entries increased during the study period. The 2006 NAMCS survey allowed for collection of three unique diagnoses and eight unique prescriptions. In 2012, the maximum number of drugs collected was raised to twelve and 2014 saw that number increased again to thirty. The maximum number of diagnoses recorded was raised from 3 to 5 in 2014 as well. In order to accurately measure trends across the study period, only diagnoses 1-3 and prescriptions 1-8 were considered as explicitely instructed in documentation \cite{schappert_analyzing_nodate}.\\
\indent In order to ensure analsysis is of relevant medical visits, I use daignoses which led to a prescription of ST to restrict the sample. For years 2006-2015 diagnoses are label using ICD-9-CM codes and used ICD-10-CM codes for the year 2016. To allow for comparability across all years of the study, each ICD-10-CM code was recoded as its exact or closest ICD-9-CM counterpart. I designate each diagnosis to be a relevant diagnosis if a visit which lead to the diagnosis also lead to a prescription of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim. All visits where none of these relevant diagnoses were made are dropped from the sample. Because all relevant diagnoses are given equal importance regardless of whether it was the specific one which led to the prescription, it is possible that this strategy does not fully rid the sample of all non relevant visits which would negatively bias our estimates.\\
\indent To further control for nonrelevant visits, I create an indicator for on label diagnoses. Reasons for prescribing antibiotics can be categorized as on label and off label. On label indications are the FDA approved reasons for precribing mentioned above while off label indications are non FDA approved indications. Each on label indication is mapped to one or more ICD-9-CM codes illustrated in \autoref{tab:Table4.1}. I consider a visit where one or on label diagnoses were made to be an on label visit and visits where no on label diagnoses were made to be off label visits.

\section{Variables}
The independent variables considered in the analysis are as follows. \textbf{TimeSinceGeneric} is a continuous variable from -82 to 49 and indicates the number months since the generic version of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim entered the market (November of 2012). Defining the timeline this way means that the months before November of 2012 are take negative values. For example, September of 2012 (3 months before generic entry) would be coded as \textbf{timeSinceGeneric}$=-2$. I include \textbf{age} and \textbf{ageSQ} which are the ages and squared ages of the patient at the time of the visit respectively. Lastly, I include the indicators \textbf{offLabel}, \textbf{govInsurance}, \textbf{nonWhite}, and \textbf{unspecCellAbscess}. OffLabel indicates that none of the diagnoses which resulted from the visit were FDA approved indications for Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim. GovInsurance and nonWhite indicate whether a patient was Medicare or Medicaid and if the patient was a race other than white respectively. Lastly, \textbf{unspecCellAbscess} indicates if a patient was diagnosed with an Unscpecified Skin Abscess or Cellulitis. We include this diagnosis because, although it is considered an off label indication for Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, it was the diagnosis associated with the most prescriptions of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim.\\
\indent \autoref{tab:Table4.1} is a statiscal summary of the continuous variables \textbf{timeSinceGeneric}, \textbf{age}, and \textbf{ageSQ}. I present the variables in the context of the entire study followed by summaries for before and after generic entry. From the table it is clear the study goes across 131 months from January of 2006 (\textbf{timeSinceGeneric}$=-82$) to December of 2016 (\textbf{timeSinceGeneric}$=49$) with \textbf{timeSinceGeneric}$=0$ indicating Novemeber of 2012 when the generic Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim entered the market. It is important to note that \textbf{timeSinceGeneric}$=0$ is included in "After Generic Entry". The final item of note from the table is the age average age of the patient during the study period increased in the months after the generic entry by roughly 1.9 years from 45.236 years old to 47.159 years old.\\
\indent \autoref{tab:Table4.2} Is the statistical summary of the categorical variables \textbf{offLabel}, \textbf{govInsurance}, and \textbf{nonWhite}. We see that the vast proportion of visits in the sample did not havea on label indication of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim diagnosed. Off label visits accounted for over 96\% of the weighted sampled across each time period. Patients on government insurance (Medicare or Medicaid) made up over a quarter of all visits over the entire time period and their weighted share of the sample increased from 24.9\& to 28.1\% during the time after the generic was introduced. Nonwhite patients make up less of the sample with a weighted average of 16.4\% over the entire study. Similar to the government insurance group, this category saw a similar, albiet smaller, increase in their weighted proportion of the sample after the generic came on from 16\% to 17.3\%. The final category, those diagnosed with an unscpecified skin abscess or cellulitis, made up 5.4\% of the weighted sample across the entire study and decreased from 5.5\% to 5.2\% once the generic entered the market.

\autoref{tab:Table4.4} provides a look at the weighted proportion of patients of each type which were prescribed Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim. Overall, .861\% of all visits lead to a prescription of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim over the study period with an increase of .029 percentage points post generic entry. Looking only at off label visits, the numbers do not change a great deal. The weighted proportion prescribed the drug was .0718\& across the study and increased from .0696\% to .078\% between the time periods of before and after generic entry. The story does change for the compliment of the off label category. Visits that saw at least one on label indication for Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim led to a prescription of the antibiotic 5.07\% of the time. However, this proportion decreased nearly 1 percentage point from 5.35\% to 4.53\% between the two time periods.\\
\indent The other categorical variables tell similar stories to the entire sample while. Patients on government insurance were prescibed Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim for .871\% of there total visits and saw an increase from .806\% to .975\%. Patients not on any form of government insurance saw their proportion of visits which lead to a prescription of the antibiotic fall slightly from .865\% to .843\%. For nonwhite patients, the weighted proportion of visits leading to a prescription of the drug was .933\% with an increase from .846\% to 1.08\% between the two timeframes. White patients did not see a similar increase as their proportion decreased from .852\% to .838\%. Finally, patients with an unspecified skin abscess or cellulitis had the largest propotion of visits lead to a presciption of the drug with 17.5\% across the entire study. This group also saw an increase of 1.4\% percentage points from the period before entry of the generic to the period after.
