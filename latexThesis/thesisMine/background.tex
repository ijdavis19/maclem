\section{Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim}
\indent For simplification, I focus our analysis to prescriptions of Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim. Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim is a combination antibiotic from the class antimetabolite/sulfonamide and was first introduced in 1968. The brand versions of the drug include Bactrim, Bactrim DS, Septra, and Septra DS and the generic form entered the American market in July of 2012. The antibiotic was popular even before generic entry due its high familiarity among physicians and low cost \cite{noauthor_sulfamethoxazole_nodate,ho_considerations_2011}. The drug has FDA approval to fight urinary tract infections, ear infections (acute otitis media), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults, Shigellosis, treatment and prophylaxis of \textit{Pneumocystis jirovecii} pneumonia, and Traveler's diarrhea in a adults. The antibiotic is also used for infections due to \textit{Listeria, Nocardia, Salmonella, Brucella, Paracoccidioides,} melioidosis, \textit{Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas,} cyclospora, isospora, Whipple's disease, and alterntive therapy for toxoplasmosis and community-acquired MRSA skin infections \cite{schlossberg_antibiotics_2017}. While not specifically named by the FDA, evidence has been found which indicates Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim is successful in treating uncomplicated skin abcesses \cite{noauthor_trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole_nodate}\\

\section{Literature Review}
The literature on the subject of antibiotic and more general prescription practices is approached different by and within disciplines. The economonic literature primariliy focuses on theoretical implications of prescription markets while the pharma/medical researches perform large scale trend analysis but off less attempts to explain the mechanations of the trends.\\
\indent Economics is this this and that. This paper serves to establish so on and so forth. Hitherto foretold and ergo cogito. More or Less. So on and so forth.\\
\indent That is not to say economic research has completely ignored the emprical aspects of this research. This and that happened with this and that leading to this and that. Also he wrote with her what this is.\\
\indent The more specilized medical researchers are more concerned with presenting trends but less concerned with rigoursly questioning the underlying bases. That is not to say worthwhile finding have not be made. This and that and this. That then this. Then this then that.
