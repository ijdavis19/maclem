	abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to determine trends in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of erythromycin used as first-line therapy and alternative antibiotics against Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) strains isolated from patients with whooping cough in the Czech Republic (CR) in three periods from 1967 to 2015.
Methods: In total, 135 isolates from the years 1967–2015 were analysed. The strains were divided into three groups by the year of isolation: 1967–1999 (42 strains), 2004–2010 (43 strains), and 2011–2015 (50 strains). MIC of selected antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) were obtained by the reference agar dilution method on Bordet Gengou Agar with 15\% defibrinated sheep blood.
Results: The study set included 70 strains previously tested for MICs of erythromycin and four other antibiotics. In the three study periods, the MICs of the tested antibiotics for B. pertussis were nearly identical. All but a single strain, inhibited by erythromycin at a concentration of 0.03 mg/l, were inhibited by two concentrations of erythromycin and azithromycin (0.06 and 0.125 mg/l). Clarithromycin inhibited the strains from all three study periods at the following concentrations: 0.03, 0.06, and 0.125 mg/l. Any of the 135 strains was inhibited by ciprofloxacin at a single concentration of 0.06 mg/l and by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole at three concentrations (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/l).
Conclusion: The study set of 135 Czech strains of B. pertussis isolated in 1967–2015 appears to be homogeneous in terms of the MICs for five antimicrobials. The MICs remained in a narrow range of two to three low concentrations; the unimodal distribution of the MICs suggests the absence of resistance mechanisms. The highest MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin were equally 0.125 mg/l, that of ciprofloxacin was 0.06 mg/l, and that of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was 0.5 mg/l. Over the study period of 55 years, the MICs of the study antibiotics remained in the same ranges.},

	abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in Latin America between 1997 to 2000 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. In the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. The patients’ mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6\%). Esherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Among the E. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious UTI in Latin America (91.0 –100.0\% susceptible). High resistance rates to ﬂuoroquinolones (17.5–18.9\%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Ͼ45.0\%) were observed among the E. coli. In contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of Ͼ 87.0\%. Against Klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (Ͼ30.0\%) producing extended-spectrum ␤-lactamases (ESBL). Even the new ﬂuoroquinolones showed limited activity against Klebsiella spp. (72.1– 88.6\% susceptible) and the P. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. The results of this survey endorse the importance of Enterobacteriaceae as cause of UTI in Latin America. Our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the Latin American medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciproﬂoxacin-resistant E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

	title = {Trends in antibiotic susceptibility patterns and epidemiology of {MRSA} isolates from several hospitals in {Riyadh}, {Saudi} {Arabia}},
	abstract = {Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates with rapid development of resistance.
Methods: A total of 512 MRSA isolates were procured from 6 major hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and antibiotic susceptibilities and MICs were documented against several antibiotics and vancomycin. SPSS version 10 was used for statistical analysis.
Results: The prevalence of MRSA in the study hospitals ranged from 12\% to 49.4\%. Mean patient age was 44 years with males constituting 64.4\% and females 35.6\%. Approximately 41.5\% of the isolates came from patients in the extreme age groups. MIC for vancomycin was in the susceptible range for all isolates ranging from 0.25 to 3 ug/ml. The overall susceptibility of MRSA to the various antibiotics tested was: fusidic acid 4.3\%, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 33.8\%, gentamicin 39.6\%, mupirocin 77.0\%, gatifloxacin 78.9\%, chloramphenicl 80.7\%, linezolid 95.1\%, quinupristin/ dalfopristin 100\%. Some differences were noted in the resistance of isolates among the participating hospitals reflecting antibiotic usage. On the whole, inpatient isolates (accounting for 77.5\% of the isolates) were more resistant than outpatient isolates (22.5\%) except for linezolid. Quinupristindalfopristin and linezolid are the most effective antibiotics tested against inpatient isolates while quinupristin-dalfopristin and gatifloxacin seem to be the most effective against outpatient isolates. Approximately one forth of the isolates are no longer susceptible to mupirocin used for eradication of the carrier state reflecting resistance developing after widespread use. Trends over time show a tendency towards decreased susceptibility to gatifloxacin and linezolid with increasing susceptibility to gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.
Conclusion: Quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are two valuable additions to our antimicrobial armamentarium, but resistance has already been described. To preserve their value, their use should be limited to those rare cases where they are clearly needed. Fusidic acid, the local antibiotic, gentamicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be relied upon for treatment of MRSA infections, at least empirically as the percentage of susceptible isolates is very low.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine temporal trends of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) use in children.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study to characterize TMP-SMX ADRs in children between 2000 and 2009. We completed a chart review at our institution by identifying children diagnosed with TMP-SMX ADRs. To compare local trends to comparable institutions, we estimated the frequency of hospitalizations for TMP-SMX ADRs at 25 tertiary pediatric hospitals utilizing the Pediatric Health Information System database. To determine whether changes in outpatient prescribing rates occurred, we used the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey/National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.
RESULTS: At our institution, 109 children were diagnosed with a TMP-SMX ADR (5 cases from 2000 to 2004 as compared with 104 cases from 2005 to 2009). Fifty-eight percent had been treated for a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). A similar trend was observed nationally, where the incidence of TMP-SMX ADRs more than doubled from 2004 to 2009 at comparable pediatric hospitals (P {\textless} .001). Although national outpatient data revealed no change in overall TMP-SMX prescribing, the percentage of children prescribed TMP-SMX for SSTI sharply increased during the study period (0\%–2\% [2000-2004]; 9\%–17\% [2005–2009]).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of TMP-SMX ADRs at our institution occurred in conjunction with SSTI treatment. TMP-SMX ADRs have occurred more frequently coincident with increased prescribing for SSTI. Increased usage alone may explain the increasing trend of TMP-SMX ADRs in children; however drug–disease interaction may play a role and requires further investigation.},
