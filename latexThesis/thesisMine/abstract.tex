\chapter*{Abstract}
Due to the increased emphasis on antibiotic stewardship, careful attention must be paid to the study of antibiotic demand and factors which affect it. The purpose of this paper is the estimate the effect of generic entry on antibiotic demand through changes in the probability of prescription using Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim as a case study. I pool data of outpatient ambulatory care visits from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys from 2006-2016 to estimate probability of prescription of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim for various groups of patients both before and after generic entry. I estimate and increase of 1.88 percentage points (CI 90\%) in the probability of prescription due to generic entry for patients with FDA approved reasons for prescription of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim. Visits where patients were not diagnosed with FDA approved reasons for prescription of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim saw no significant change in probability of prescription.
