\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent
TBD
%Talking about efficacy complcates things. Really its prescriptions and not usage. 
%Modify the model for the data that we have at hand (which is not efficacy)
%Model should really be perscriptions in t with price and stuff
%Don't say "Best Way"
%It's the patient's demand and the physician serves his/her own role.
%Bring in proposal language and the WORDING of the models currently written under economic model
%Use the economic model section to talk about the actual model

%Throw the questions from the proposal in at the end of the introduction

%Try to answer the question of "How am I going to estimate this model?"

%Intro
%Data on original question
%Data on explanetory variables
%Individual Probability Model
  %These covariates might matter and here are some groups
  %Discuss which ones we "know" for sure that we want to include
  %Just include the first and last column in the variable list

So this is a little more purposeful than anticipated.
\section{Economic Model}
\label{sec:economic model}

\noindent
The model we posit is that the effectiveness of a given antibiotic $i$ in time $t$ is a function of its effectiveness in time period $t-1$, its usage in $t-1$, the effectiveness of close substitutes $\bm{j}$ in time period $t-1$, and the usage of substitutes $\bm{j}$ in time period $t -1$. Additionally, this usage in a given time period $t$ is also a funciton of the prices and effectiveness of the antibiotic $i$ and close substitutes $\bm{j}$ in said time period.
\begin{eqnarray}
  \text{efficacy}_t &=& g(\text{usage}_{i,t-1},\text{usage}_{\bm{j},t-1},)\\
  \text{usage}_t &=& f(\text{efficacy}_{i,t},\text{price}_{i,t},\text{efficacy}_{\bm{j},t},\text{price}_{\bm{j},t})
\end{eqnarray}
From supply and demand we are led to the hyposthesis that the market entry caused by the expiration of an antibiotic's patent will lead to a significant decrease in price. This change will increase usage and, in turn, decrease effectiveness. The best way to tease out this interaction involves considering the probability of being perscribed a given antibiotic conditional on having an appropriate condition. An increase in this probability is a necessary condition for the patent status to have any effect on antibiotic usage and effectiveness.
%Sit on this
  % \text{Pr}(\text{prescription of drug}\; i\; |\;\text{symption set} \: x \: \text{at time} \: t)

%Discussion of the model will occur here but not of the statistical model and we will not be assuming functional form. Instead, we are going to carefully talk about what we think is occuring and why it would happen. Something about like going back to Laxminarayan and saying "Well this is how bacteria mutate so naturally this is how intellectual property laws could affect that." Again, we are not assuming functional form (but there is an important time element) so it'll be something like


%\begin{eqnarray} %no * because we may want to reference these
  %effectiveness_t = f(quality_t,quantity_{t-1}(price_{t-1},patentStatus_{t-1},...),...)
%\end{eqnarray}
%It could also be important to mention the different way's effectiveness could be measured but that may be best referenced here after a more flushed out discussion in the introduction.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\noindent
We began by considering the 70 antibiotics categorized by the United Nations World Health Organization as "Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine." We added the date of the first generic appearance for each of the antibiotics using data from \textit{drugs.com}.\\

We then used the Prescriber's Digital Reference to pull out the possible indications (reasons for use) of each antibiotic with the intention of possibly charting similarities to determine which drugs can be considered close substitutes.\\

In order to get idea of antibiotic usage, we use the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. This nationally representative dataset from years 2006-2016 describes physician, facility, and patient characteristics as well as which drugs were presecribed and for what diagnoses. One drawback of the data is it's use of unlabled numerical codes for diagnoses. While these codes are consistent through the years, it does not allow for analysis of specific diagnosis. Additionally, because the data are only available for 2006-2016, we are restricted to antibiotics who came off patent well within that range.\\

Of the 70 antibiotics we began with, this restriction limits our analysis to the 8 which came off patent within 2006-2016. In order to allow for a reasonable amount of observations before and after the expiration, we are left with 5 drugs that provide us with at least 2 years before and after expiration. The monthly probabiltiies of perscription for each of these antibiotics are shown in the figure below.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Prescription Probabilities of Antibiotics of Interest}

\includegraphics{aztreonam-1.png}
\includegraphics{cefotetan-1.png}\\
\includegraphics{linezolid-1.png}
\includegraphics{sulfamethoxazole-1.png}\\
\includegraphics{tinidazole-1.png}\\
\end{figure}
\\Sulfamethoxazole and Tinidazole became the combination drug Sulfamethoxazole-Tinidazole which is not coded in the data and there is uncertainty whether some prescriptions of Sulfamethoxazole are not the combination.\\
\\
Because the probabiltiy of an observation presenting symptoms appropriate for being prescribed a given antibiotic may vary over time, we use the datasets to determine what can be considered relevant diagnoses by throwing out all observations which do not have a diagnosis that leads to at least one prescription of a given antibiotic between 2006 and 2016. These data are then appended to create one dataset for a given antibiotic spanning 10 years with every observation containing a relevant diagnonsis. The full list of variables in these sets is shown below. \textbf{Need to add actual prescription indicator}
%First we need to talk about our antibiotics and which one's we are sticking with and why. Throw out the pictures of cefotetan and maybe sulfamethazole. I guess I can bang out one or two new datasets pretty quickly so it would only be a difficulty regarding naming everything and playing around in my terminal.\\I might've jumped the gun. First, talk about all of the antibiotics we fist got data on from the critically important for human health list. Next, we narrowed down the list to ones that came off patently recentlyish. Then we looked for which ones would be the best to use.\\Next, we are really going to get in to the National Ambulatory Healthcare Survey. We are going to talk a little about how it \textit{was} formatted and a lot about how it \textit{is} formatted. The current format is crucial because it has to lay the groundwork for a discussion on what statistical models can be leveraged later on. From here we can talk about how we found specific drugs that were interesting and fit the model of how we thought it should look.\\\\It would be really nice to be able to speak briefly and in English about the one or two drugs I want to look at. Just to give context for what these things do and stuff.\\\noindentNow, we can go into the question of tying it to resistance rates. I guess talk about (or rule out) the possibilities of using MIB's, MIC's, or aggregated antibiograms for a possible connection with resistance.
