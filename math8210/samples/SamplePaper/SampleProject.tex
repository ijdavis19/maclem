{\bf Here you introduce the problem.  What you are doing for
    the project. }
    
\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\noindent
{\bf Here you talk about your problem, introduce whatever
     science and math are necessary to understand what is going on.
     Sort of like a tutorial or a lecture to bright, yet
     untrained in this area, colleagues.  This can be split over several
     sections if required.}
     
\section{YOUR SPECIFIC TASK }
\label{sec:task}

For the title of this section, use something better
than {\bf YOUR SPECIFIC TASK}.  Pick a title relevant to the project.

\noindent
{\bf What your task was and how you accomplished it.
    This can include theoretical development, algorithm development
    and software issues.  This can be spread over several sections
    if necessary.}
    
\section {Results}
\label{sec:results}

\noindent
{\bf Discuss your accomplishments.}

\section{Acknowledgements}

This is where you acknowledge people, grants and so forth
that helped you do the work.  For example,
my recent work is funded by an Army grant and so I would write
this line.\\

This research has been supported by support of the Army grant {\bf W911NF-17-1-0455}

\section{Some ~\LaTeX Pointers}
\label{sec:'latexstuff}

Now here are some pointers on ~\LaTeX.

\subsection{Setting up a subsection}

\noindent
Here is how you do a subsection: note we can move heading around using the
\verb+\hspace+ command.

\singlespacing 
\myfancyverbatim{Setting Up a subsection}
\begin{lstlisting}
\subsection{Your Title Goes Here}
\label{basic}
\end{lstlisting}
\onehalfspacing
\lstset{fancyvrb=false}

\subsection{Referencing A Paper:}

Here is ~\LaTeX~ code for referencing a paper:

\singlespacing 
\myfancyverbatim{Referencing a work you want to cite}
\begin{lstlisting}
A good way to learn immunology is to read \mycite{abbas2010}!
\end{lstlisting}
\onehalfspacing
\lstset{fancyvrb=false}

\noindent
A good way to learn immunology is to read \mycite{abbas2010}!\\

\noindent
In the \mylstinline{HomologyInBio.bib} file you'll see the lines

\singlespacing 
\myfancyverbatim{A book .bib entry}
\begin{lstlisting}
@book{abbas2010,
author= {A. K. Abbas and A. H. Lichtman and S. Pillai},
title={Cellular and Molecular Immunology.},
publisher={Saunders Elsevier}, 
year={2010}}
\end{lstlisting}
\onehalfspacing
\lstset{fancyvrb=false}

\noindent
and to get the references right you do this

\singlespacing 
\myfancyverbatim{Generating the Bibliography}
\begin{lstlisting}
pdflatex SampleProject
bibtex SampleProject
pdflatex SampleProject
\end{lstlisting}
\onehalfspacing
\lstset{fancyvrb=false}

\noindent
either manually in a terminal like I do in Linux or using an integrated development
for ~\LaTeX~ in Windows or MacOS.

\subsection{Some Math Equations:}

Here are some mathematical equations.  Here is the ~\LaTeX~ 
code:

\label{con11}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
where

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{J}(x,u,t)     &=& dist(y(t_f),\Gamma) 
                  +  \int_t^{t_f} \: {\cal L}( y(s),u(s),s) \: ds 
\label{con11b}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
Subject to:
\begin{eqnarray}

\end{eqnarray}

subsection{Embedding Mathematics and Referencing Equations:}

Here is ~\LaTeX~ code to handle embedded mathematics
and referencing equations:

\singlespacing 
\myfancyverbatim{Embedding Mathematics}
\begin{lstlisting}
Here $y$ and $u$ are the {\em state vector} and
{\em control vector} of the system, respectively;
$\cal U$ is the space of functions that the control must be chosen from
during the minimization process and (~\ref{con13}) --
(~\ref{con15}) give the initialization and constraint conditions that
the state and control must satisfy. 
The set $\Gamma$ represents a target constraint set
and $dist(y(t_f),\Gamma)$ indicates the distance from
the final state $y(t_f)$ to the constraint set $\Gamma$.

\subsection{Inserting C Source Into The Document:}

Here is simple ~\LaTeX~ code I have used to
insert C code into a paper:

\singlespacing 
\begin{Verbatim}
Each output component of the CMAC structure has the identical input
architecture specified by the {\em "C" structures} {\bf cmacinput}
and {\bf cmac}.  For expositional cleanness, these structures have been
stripped down to bare essentials: in a working simulation, there will
of course be additional diagnostic and useful items included, such as
the name and location of configuration files where all the
important setup information is stored.  We allocate space for
one cmac structure and $M$ blocks of working memory.  We will
use a fixed offset strategy of offset $O = \frac{1}{L}$, where
$L$ is the number of levels.

\mylistcode{C}{The cmacinput structure}{code:cmacone}

\subsection{Using subfigures}

\noindent
Here's how you use the \mylstinline{subfigure} environment.

\singlespacing
\myfancyverbatim{Subfigures}
\onehalfspacing
\lstset{fancyvrb=false}

\noindent
\LaTeX~ output:

Consider the average sodium and potassium time constant values given in Figure \ref{fig:averagenat} and
Figure \ref{fig:averagek1t} respectively.

\subsection{Including a .png file}

\noindent
Here's how you embed a .png file: note the full path name must be entered as one line--do not 
carriage return because the line is too long.  That will screw things
up!

\noindent
\LaTeX~ output:

Consider the outline for cognitive processing given in Figure \ref{figure:metaone}.


\subsection{A Sample with citations, quotes etc}

Here is another nice sample.

\myfancyverbatim{Sample with references}
\begin{lstlisting}
Here we use \verb+\mycite+ as defined at the top of this document
to call \verb+natbib+ to setup the references.

In \mycite{peterson2015a} and \mycite{peterson2015b}, we explore a micro
level simulation model of a single host's response to varying levels of
West Nile Virus (WNV) infection.  In that infection, there is a substantial
self damage component and in those papers, we show that
this is probably due to the way that the virus infects two
cell populations differently.  This difference, which involves
an larger upregulation of MHC-1 sites on the surface
of non-dividing infected cells over dividing infected cells,
is critical in establishing a self damage or collateral damage response.
In \mycite{peterson2015c}, we develop a macro level model
of the nonlinear interactions between two critical \emph{signaling}
agents that mediate the interaction between these two sets of cell populations.
In the case of WNV infection, the two signals are the MHC-1 upregulation level
of the cell and the free WNV antigen level.  This macro model allowed
us to predict a host's health response to varying levels of initial virus dose.
Hence, we could begin to understand the oscillations in collateral damage
and host health that lead to the survival data we see in WNV infections.
The more general musings of \mycite{peterson2015c} were then 
extended to the setting of auto immune interactions in general
in \mycite{peterson2015d}.  In this work, we explore how viral infections
in the Central Nervous System (CNS) can generate an auto immune
response.

For background, we will follow the presentation of \mycite{kasahara2010}
in what follows.
The adaptive immune system (AIS) arose about $450$ million years ago
from a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates.  The emergence of this system
is probably two rounds of whole-genome duplication.  This event gave the jawed
vertebrate ancestor many paralogous genes which play essential roles
in T cell and B cell immunity.  These genes are known as \emph{ohnologs}
and are very important as they encode key components of the antigen
presentation machinery and also the signal transduction pathway for
lymphocyte activation.  When and how T cell immunity arose is important
because it sheds light on how T cell problems with self versus non self may have arisen
and continue to be an issue in modern vertebrates.  We know that
T cell receptors (TCRs) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
are present in all classes of jawed vertebrates but not there in jawless vertebrates.

Now we quote from the source \mycite{kasahara2010} using \verb+\jimquote+

In \mycite{peterson2015a} and \mycite{peterson2016c}, we explore a micro
level simulation model of a single host's response to varying levels of
West Nile Virus (WNV) infection.  In that infection, there is a substantial
self damage component and in those papers, we show that
this is probably due to the way that the virus infects two
cell populations differently.  This difference, which involves
an larger upregulation of MHC-1 sites on the surface
of non-dividing infected cells over dividing infected cells,
is critical in establishing a self damage or collateral damage response.
In \mycite{peterson2017a}, we develop a macro level model
of the nonlinear interactions between two critical \emph{signaling}
agents that mediate the interaction between these two sets of cell populations.
